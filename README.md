Hey 👋 <br> 
I'm Antônio, a 25yo developer from Brazil 🟩🟨


<br>

I am a self-taught programmer, a Software Analysis and Development undergraduate and also a bachelor in International Relations 🌎. What made me choose development as a career is the possibility to help people, companies and public entities through technology. 
  
I want to use my creativity as fuel for innovations 💡. In order to do that, I understand that I need to be constantly studying, practicing and sharing my knowledge with others 🤝!
