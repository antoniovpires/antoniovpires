I have always been a very curious person, and I would never stop studying about the most diverse subjects 🧐. I am a self-taught programmer, and also a bachelor in International Relations 🌎. What drove me to programming/web developing is the possibility to help people through technology. 
  
I want to use my creativity and effort to develop some innovations of my own 💡. In order to do that, I understand that I must always improve my skills and share my knowledge with awesome people 🤝! Therefore, feel free to contact me through my e-mail:

Currently, I am working on my own projects to acquire experience and boost my confidence 📚. They are all simple/fictional projects, but they all involve JavaScript, HTML and CSS 👨‍💻. With Python, I have developed some solutions for my own e-commerce 🛒. I would love to be part of projects that seek technological solutions for environmental and/or social problems!


My current skills:

🟧 HTML5 / 🟦 CSS3 / 🟨 JAVASCRIPT / 🐘 PHP / 🐍 PYTHON / NODEJS

Skills in progress:

⚛ REACT / 🎸 ELECTRIC GUITAR / 🦙 SPANISH

🖖
